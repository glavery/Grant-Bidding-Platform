# API configuration
# For local development, point to your local API server
# For production, use the actual API endpoint (possibly with HTTPS)
REACT_APP_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000

# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. This is just an example file. Create a real .env file based on this template.
# 2. Never commit your actual .env file to version control.
# 3. In production, ensure API endpoints use HTTPS.
# 4. For production builds, consider using environment-specific builds rather than runtime environment variables.
